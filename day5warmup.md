# Day 5 Warmup

To get you back into thinking about code, I want you to try the following:

*Fizzbuzz*

This is a common programming exercise. If you get really stuck, you can find information about it.

### Task

For each number from 1 to 1000, if that number is divisible by 3, print "fizz". If it's divisible by 7, print "buzz". If it's divisible by both, print "fizzbuzz". Otherwise, print the number.

### Hints

* Start by printing each number
* There are multiple ways to do this, but one of the best is with an `if`, two `elif`, and an `else`
* Remember that `%` is *modulo* and the result of `x % y` is the remainder when x is divided by y
